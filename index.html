    		This table and map were created using information provided from the crowdsourced police shooting data from 
    		<a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202"
    		target="_blank">deadspin</a>. We decided to focus on whether or not the victim was
    		armed at the time of shooting, and were rather suprised by the number of unknown responses in the table.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    	In the map below, the colors indicate if the victim was <span id="armed"> armed </span>
    		or <span id="unarmed"> unarmed</span>. There are also filters that can hide or show circles based on race.
